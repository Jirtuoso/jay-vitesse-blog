# My Journey Through Three Cities: From Vancouver to San Francisco

Throughout the past 4 years of my university career, I've worked 3 internships in 3 drastically different cities - remote from Vancouver, hybrid from Toronto, and hybrid from San Francisco.

San Francisco has been my favorite experience by far, simply because I was forced outside of my comfort zone. I had nobody in my rolodex in SF, yet I felt completely at home after 10 short weeks. Below is a non-exhaustive list of some activities, experiences, and methods to meet people that I hope can inspire you.

## Adventures in San Francisco

- DMed a guy on Reddit who was responding to a "How to meet recent college grads" in a r/askSF thread, who eventually introduced me to my two best SF friends.

- Rented bikes and explored Golden Gate Park, Land's End, and the Presidio. Loved the West Coast nature.

- Tried to ride the subway to a 12km run (Bay to Breakers) at 5 am. Incorrectly assumed it was open — but I did meet a Stanford professor who let me ride in his Uber!

- Drove 4 hours in complete darkness through the California desert to make it to our Yosemite Airbnb.

- Experienced the beautiful, purely-American Alamo Theatre, which was leagues better than any Canadian theatre.

- Met a drunk start-up founder outside the club at 2 am, who subsequently bought a tab of acid off a random dude and popped it with zero hesitation.

- Enjoyed a sleepless night at my flat in the Mission because the Verizon across the street was robbed and the alarm was going off all night.

- Had an amazing clubbing night at Monroe (stay till the end for the fog) until I realized my shirt was inside out the whole night... by the way, you can pay $20 to skip the line.

- Worked until midnight... my manager was also online despite being in EST, which really put things into perspective.

- Had a "beach day" where it was completely overcast, windy, and the sand was cold — but hey, there was a lot of beer!

- Got to ride a motorcycle for the first time; looking back, the SF hills might've not been the best spot to start.

- Didn't cook a single meal.

## What's Next?

I am leaving for Barcelona to study abroad in two weeks. Another dimension shift!
