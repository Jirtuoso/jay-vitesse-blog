My Mom's 2010 Santa Fe SUV has served me incredibly well since I got my license five years ago. It has taken me to countless trailheads, ski mountains, and grocery stores. And yet, when it started to break down this year, I was completely helpless in taking care of it. The most advanced thing I can do with a car is spray the windshield cleaner. 

However, since then, I've negotiated with mechanics, tow trucks, and tire shops alike. I read negotiation books and happened to work a job cold-calling construction workers. These are the tips that have saved me thousands of dollars. 

1. Learn the Language

   * Before you go into any negotiation, ask ChatGPT to brief you on the common slang of the field. For tow trucks, I'd say: "I don't need a flatbed, just a wheel lift." You want to seem like an insider. 
2. Always Shop Around

   * If your car starts making noises, pay a mechanic $50 to diagnose it, and then call five different shops to ask for a preliminary quote range. They won't give you a hard number unless it's a very clear job. 
   * Be short, casual, and succinct in your calls.
   * When asking for a quote, always ask for the person's name at the start - that way, you have a definite reference such as "John told me it would be $400."
   * All mechanics know their competitors by name. Don't be afraid to drop it when negotiating between shops. "Dave from XYZ Autoshop down Smith St. quoted me $350, any chance you can beat that?" 
3. On-Site Negotiation

   * The real negotiation starts when you bring the car to the shop. Mechanics often try to raise the price once you show up with a BS excuse, such as "Oh it looks worse than I thought." You need to be willing to walk away and call their bluff. 
   * Show up with exact cash, with a couple extra hundred stashed in a separate wallet. 
   * Be mindful of appearances, don't dress like you're expensive.
   * Always make small talk.
   * Don't look like you're in a rush.
