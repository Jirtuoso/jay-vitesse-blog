I took on student debt to go on Study Abroad in my final semester of college. From an *Adventure per Dollar* point of view, it was money well spent. The irony is that (and many globetrotters may relate), I was begging to return home by the end of it. Seesawing between attending finance classes to packing at 4 am, every single day for 119 days straight was different, with a complete lack of routine or consistency.

This is a list of my most memorable experiences in each place I visited, which I hope can serve as inspiration for things to do or as an example of the kinds of serendipitous encounters that travel affords. It may also help you weigh the cost-benefit analysis on the labor of traveling.

- Tasted port wine to my absolute delight in Porto – this is a wine we need to tell more college students about…
- Formally asked my girlfriend out at the Eiffel Tower in Paris, while it was sparkling, of course
- Met an official TED speaker and her kids at a rooftop thermal bath in Budapest
- Hï, Ibiza :)
- Hiked the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland
- Swam in the Adriatic Sea on a hidden beach off the coast of Dubrovnik
- Sneered at a Kazakh billionaire’s yacht, the *Dynasty*, in Malaga
- Slobbered over some dry-aged Florentine steak in Florence
- Sat, painfully, on an 8-hour drive out to the Sahara Desert in Morocco with a high-grade fever
- Saw the Northern Lights dance in the polar night of Tromsø
- Caught *Frozen* in London’s West End, which singlehandedly kickstarted my appreciation for theatre
- Let go of all my inhibitions at the Amsterdam Music Festival
- Winced at the 500-person lineup for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and f**ked off
- Stumbled into a man cracking open a stolen suitcase in an alley in Venice
- Stared at Goya’s *Saturn Devouring His Son* and Bosch’s *Garden of Earthly Delights* in Madrid
- Candidly, snoozed through Joshua Bell & the Wiener Symphoniker in Vienna, as well as the endless number of Christmas markets
- Witnessed a heavily tattooed man randomly assault our tour guide on a Free Walking Tour in Lisbon and run away, after which the poor girl immediately started bawling :(
- Graciously received a few racist gestures during a bar escalation in Milan
- Walked around some dilapidated, communist-era buildings in Gdansk
- Toured Lidl, amongst a million other activities, in Barcelona
- Bonded with some American business students at the Vzorkovna Dog Bar in Prague
